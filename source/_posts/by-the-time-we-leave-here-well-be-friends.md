This whole story is a metaphor for something. A barn-sized metaphor that I couldn't hit the broad side of with a really big rock. I say really big rock because this book is like a really big rock and reading it was like pushing said really big rock from one place to another. Not a long distance but a difficult one.

The rock is jagged and blunt in all the right places that make it hard to hold onto. Sometimes poetic. Sometimes frantic. Often self-indulgent. Most of the time monotonous. Considering the backdrop of the story is a Russian gulag filled with dirtbags passing time by smoking opium and hurting each other, then drinking prison tea and hurting each other, then smoking opium and hurting each other, monotony does a great job conveying living hell.

The rock's dust jacket says the rock hinges on ESCAPE but, twist, it hinges on METAPHOR. ESCAPE doesn't even get mentioned till the last twenty percent of the rock. The first eighty percent spends its time jumping willy nilly between daily tasks, psychadelic feaver dreams, and light conversation which all mostly seem to just add folds to METAPHOR.

By the end of it all, I felt a little more stupid. Not because I pushed a rock, but because I allowed a rock to taunt me the whole time with a metaphor that I could only maybe glimpse if I pushed it a few more times. In all sincerity, this seems like a very personal story that I can't imagine anyone writing without having suffered, which I appreciate. I didn't really enjoy it. I want to say it was bad but I think that's mostly because I didn't get it and am frustrated by my own lack of reading comprehension.
