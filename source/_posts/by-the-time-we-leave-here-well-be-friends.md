This whole story is a metaphor for something. A barn-sized metaphor that I couldn't hit the broad side of with a really big rock. I say really big rock because this book is like a really big rock and reading it was like pushing said really big rock from one place to another. Not a long distance but a difficult one.

Sometimes poetic. Sometimes frantic. Often self-indulgent. This story is  jagged and blunt in all the right places that make it hard to hold onto. Mostly, though, it was monotonous. Considering the backdrop of the story is a Russian gulag filled with dirtbags passing time by smoking opium and hurting each other, then sucking prison tea and hurting each other, then smoking opium and hurting each other, monotony does a great job conveying living hell.

The book's dust jacket says this is a tail of ESCAPE (from gulag) but, twist, it's about METAPHOR. ESCAPE isn't even mentioned before you're eighty percent of the way through, all the while jumping willy nilly between daily tasks, psychadelic feaver dreams, and light conversation which all mostly seem to just add folds to METAPHOR. Folds usually come in the form "scenes" free of exposition and loaded with chopped up sentences. Imagine pouring out a box of lucky charms. Imagine the marshmallows are words and the useless cereal part, periods. Now read it.

I'm realizing I haven't mentioned the characters yet. There are characters.

By the end, I felt a little more stupid. Not because I pushed a rock, but because I allowed a rock to taunt me the whole time with a metaphor that I could only maybe glimpse if I pushed it a few more times. I didn't really enjoy it, though, so that probably won't happen. I want to say it was bad but I think that's mostly because I didn't get it and am frustrated by my own lack of skill in reading comprehension. It managed to churn my guts a few times, which I'll always give points for.

In all sincerity, this seems like a very personal story that I can't see anyone writing without having suffered, which I appreciate. I'd like to read more by the author in the hopes that they've become more liberal in their descriptions.
