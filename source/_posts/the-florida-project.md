There's this guy I knew in high school. He was good for a laugh but usually at the expense of someone's balls. I didn't notice when he hadn't been around for a while till someone asked about him. It didn't take long till there was a story going around that he wandered off drunk, got clipped by a train and stumbled into the ocean, never to be seen again. I looked him up on Facebook - he's fine. 

John and David are like the idiot mentioned above: less for the crotch games and more for the urban legend-y quality. These are the guys I'd play movie theater hotdog baseball with when we should have been wiping the concession counters for the millionth time. They weren't popular but were well known for the dumb shit they did. What else do you do when you work crap jobs, in a turd town, with a shit education? Start a cult? The main difference here is that whatever tall tales pop up about them are way less weird than what's really going on.

The idea of "early twenty-somethings fighting demons and saving the world" isn't new but also isn't usually this good; which absolutely comes from the quality of the characters. John's roundabout brand of genuine love and concern tossed with David's disdain for both normal and abnormal life, add up to something compelling enough without alternate plains of existence. I would have kept reading if it was just about them trying to pay bills and out-wiener joke each other.

Luckily, there's a lot more than that.  Like spooky shadow boys, a helpful dog, butt jokes, cops, a doctor(?), the soy sauce squad, Amy, gore, and insane burrowing mind control mosquitos.

One of David Wong's (the author is the main character) greatest strengths is to play with perspective and perception. It's the butter slathered on the bread that is the dirt city of [Undisclosed]. The series of stories in this book are told by David to a skeptical reporter. It's a little bit clunky and cliche (purposefully?) but carries an interesting twist thanks to said skills. When the third member of the team, Amy, shows up, it really shows off how easy it is to misperceive not just the creeps in the shadows, but the weirdo in your "special needs" class too. Toward the end, things become more abstract and David Wong loosen's his grip a bit but the results bring some deep humility and complexity to David, John and Amy.

Since reading, I've been considering my own mortality a lot. We are all very frail and dumb.
